### Hi, I'm Julita Turaj! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

As a Fullstack Developer with experience in PHP (Laravel) and Vue.js, I am excited to explore new technologies and expand my skillset. Specifically, I am interested in transitioning to Node.js with Nest.js, and I am eager to take on new challenges in this area. Currently I am #opentowork

In my current role in the automotive industry, I have worked on a range of projects, including e-commerce platforms and inventory management systems. I have a strong understanding of both front-end and back-end development, with expertise in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Vue.js, PHP, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

I am a collaborative team player who enjoys working with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality web applications that meet business objectives and user needs. I have a proven track record of leading development projects from concept to deployment, and I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices.
